Getting Started
###############

There are multiple ways to get started using WebGNOME. For example, various
wizards are available that guide users through setting up a scenario. In this 
case, users will be prompted to answer a sequence of questions. Users can 
also choose a Custom Setup and load and enter all input data manually.

No matter which way users begin, some elements will be constant once the 
model is setup. 

Switching between Model Views
-----------------------------
To switch between Views in the model, the icons
pictured below are always found on the top right of the Menu Bar.

 - To make modifications to the model setup, switch to Setup View.
 - To view the oil budget, switch to Fate View.
 - To view the oil trajectory, switch to Map View.
