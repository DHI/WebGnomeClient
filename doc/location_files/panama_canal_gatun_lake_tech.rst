About Panama Canal Gatun Lake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This Location File models flow from the Chagras River through controlled releases from the Madden Dam into Lake Gatun and down the Canal towards the Pacific. In addition to the Chagres River, the lake receives the waters of numerous rivers and streams. Gatun Lake is part of the route followed by shipping through the Panama Canal. 


Background
=============================================

Gatun Lake is a massive artificial lake crossing through Panama between the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It forms a major part of the Panama Canal, transiting ships for 33 km across the Isthmus of Panama. The lake was created between 1907 and 1913 during the creation of the Gatun Dam. 
Circulation in the region is driven primarily by controlled releases from the Madden Dam. River flow from smaller tributaries does not have a significant impact on surface currents in the lake.


Current Patterns
======================================

The Panama Canal, Gatun Lake Location File uses four current patterns to simulate circulation in the lake and flow in the canal. 

One of the currents models flow from the Chagres River down the canal toward the Pacific and another models flow from the Chagres River towards Lake Gatun, and a third models flow from other inlets to the lake. The high, medium, and low flow values were extrapolated from mean flow reported in ...

A wind-driven circulation pattern is used to simulate wind driven flow in the lake: one pattern from NW winds and another from NE winds. These two patterns are combined linearly to produce a current pattern appropriate for the user-defined wind field.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
