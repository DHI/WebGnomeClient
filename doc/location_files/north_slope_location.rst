Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Location File for the North Slope, Alaska! This File is the third in a series for this area, covering the region of significant oil development that occurs on the North Slope. The North Slope Location File combines the two previous Arctic Location Files – Stefansson Sound and Harrison and Gwydyr Bays – and extends east into Canada to include the Mackenzie River delta as well.

The Arctic Ocean in this region, the Beaufort Sea, is covered with ice for about nine months each year. By mid-July, the Beaufort is usually ice-free from the shore to the edge of the pack ice, which by late summer, retreats from 6 to 60 miles (10 km to 100 km) offshore (Committee 2003). This Location File should only be used during these ice-free times.

The coastline modeled in this Location File is part of Alaska’s (and Canada’s) beautiful and fragile tundra. Tundra is a flat, treeless plain that supports shrubby or mat-like vegetation, such as low shrubs, sedges, grasses, mosses, and lichens. In Alaska, the North Slope tundra extends north from the foothills of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean, and west from the Canadian border to the Chukchi Sea.

The North Slope shoreline is irregular, containing many small bays, lagoons, spits, beaches, and barrier islands. Extensive mud flats often occur in the deltas of the rivers. Some of the larger rivers discharging into the Beaufort Sea form depositional deltas that extend several miles from the shore. Most of the coastline is low-lying, with only small bluffs less than 10 feet (3 meters) high. Some areas of the coast are directly exposed to the open ocean, and other sections are protected by chains of barrier islands that are composed of sand and gravel (Committee 2003).

Gwydyr Bay is a lagoon area west of Prudhoe Bay, between the Return Islands and the mainland in northeastern Alaska. Harrison Bay is a large inlet north and west of the Colville River Delta. Rivers in this area tend to be fast-flowing and braided, with extensive delta systems. The river systems support a diversity of plant and animal life, and can serve as corridors for migrating mammals and birds (Committee 2003). The rivers simulated in this Location File include the four Stefansson Sound rivers (Sagavanirktok [“Sag”], Canning, Shaviovik, and Tamayariak Rivers), which are shown on the map on the following page, the Colville and Kuparuk (shown on page 3) and the Mackenzie (shown on page 3):

* The Sag, begins on the north slope of the Brooks Range and flows about 180 miles (290 km) north-northwest across a broad, open floodplain to the Beaufort Sea near Prudhoe Bay.

* Another major river, the Canning, forms the western boundary of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). This river originates at a glacier in the Franklin Mountains and flows 125 miles (201 km) north to Camden Bay.

* The Shaviovik, whose name derives from an Inuit phrase meaning “place where there is iron,” flows northeast 75 miles (121 km) to the Beaufort Sea between Foggy Island and Mikkelsen Bay.

* The smallest of the Stefansson Sound rivers, the Tamayariak flows northeast 40 miles (64 km) from its lakehead at the west end of the Sadlerochit Mountains, draining into the Canning River 2 miles (3 km) southwest of its mouth.

* The Colville flows 350 miles (560 km) east and north to the Beaufort Sea, receiving inflow from the numerous tributaries that descend from the western Brooks Range.

* The Kuparuk River flows 150 miles (240 km) northward from the eastern Brooks Range, terminating in the Beaufort Sea

* The longest of the rivers, the Mackenzie, flows northward 1,080 miles (1,738 km) from its source at the shallow swamps and mudbanks of Great Slave Lake in Canada’s Northwest Territories. With its watershed covering almost one-fifth of Canada, the Mackenzie River flow parallels the Mackenzie Mountains, ending in a wide fan-shaped delta of channels and islands where it empties into the Beaufort Sea.

Background
..........

The North Slope Location File simulates open water conditions (generally occurring mid-July through mid-September) in the coastal area between Harrison Bay and the Mackenzie River delta in Canada, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) as well as Gwydyr Bay and Stefansson Sound. The Location File contains circulation patterns that simulate the wind-driven coastal circulation and the flows of some of the region’s larger rivers. Because the tidal currents are generally less than 5 cm s-1 (Endicott 1992), tides have not been included in the simulation. The Location File includes detailed circulation between the numerous barrier islands of this region; however, other than the field work done for the earlier Harrison and Gwydyr Bays Location File, we lack data for calibration of the currents.

In this Location File, seven North Slope rivers are simulated. Unfortunately, east of Prudhoe Bay few bathymetric surveys of the river channels have been conducted and very little information exists on flow rates at the mouths of the rivers. With so little data available to build the hydrodynamics of the four Stefansson Sound river channels, we could not set the range of values and user-inputs well for any of the rivers. (The Sag River has the most data; however, these data are not as good as we would like, because the gauge is very far upstream.) Other complications in simulating these rivers are that the river flow rates can change very quickly, and the physical terrain of these braided rivers includes extensive mud flats, spits, and barrier islands. Consequently, we used our best professional judgment to depict these rivers.

A result of the limitations in simulating the rivers is that more information is needed from the user in order to set the river flows within a reasonable margin of error. In this Location File, the user needs to set a flow velocity near (generally < 1 NM) the mouth of each river. The user can either (1) make an estimate by throwing an orange into the river channel and tracking it with a global positioning system (GPS), pacing off the distance traveled, or by using some other estimation method; or (2) guess a range of values and see what happens in the model. The current speeds of the rivers can be measured using many different units. To help the user with conversions of the various units, we’ve provided two conversion tables in Appendix A.

In general, the higher the river flow, the harder it is for oil to move up into the river. Wind can partly overcome the river flow to move oil, but the complicated geometry of these river mouths (e.g., braided rivers with deltas and many barrier islands) means the wind would have to change direction in just the right combination of speeds and directions in order to move the oil through these complicated channels.

Circulation
...........

The coastal circulation in the Beaufort Sea is driven by the wind and is constrained along the shoreline in either direction. Summer winds are primarily from the east to northeast, and secondarily from the west to northwest. Winds with an easterly component drive coastal circulation toward the west and offshore, while winds with a westerly component drive the coastal currents toward the east and onshore (Aagaard 1979, Barnes and Reimnitz 1974, Cannon and Hachmeister 1987, Hachmeister et al. 1987, Hale et al. 1989, Savoie and Wilson 1986). Changes in wind direction are generally reflected in the coastal circulation within a few hours (Savoie and Wilson 1986).

Wind-driven Ekman transport can alter the across-shelf surface pressure gradient. Upwelling situations tend to increase the water column stratification, while downwelling situations tend to make the water column more homogeneous (Hale et al. 1989). When the wind relaxes or reverses, the forcing sustaining this pressure gradient is released and water tends to move on- or off-shore (Savoie and Wilson 1986). Large river discharges, such as from the Mackenzie River in Canada, also create a surface plume with significant offshore velocities that move the fresher surface water offshore, creating
an estuary-like circulation with colder, more saline water moving to the surface in response (Hale et al. 1989). These effects are not simulated in this Location File.

West Dock Break
...............

We have been careful to simulate the cut through West Dock causeway to allow the coastal circulation to pass through. The surface circulation in this Location File flows both through the West Dock and as a jet around the margin of the causeway, returning shoreward on the other side, as seen in the field (Hachmeister et al. 1987, Savoie and Wilson 1986, Short et al. 1988a).

Current Patterns
................

This Location File has eight current patterns: one component of the wind-driven currents in the lagoon systems; and seven river systems: the Mackenzie, Colville, Kuparuk, Sagavanirktok (Sag), Shaviovik, Canning, and Tamayariak Rivers. All were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) hydrodynamic model.

Wind-Driven Currents
....................

Wind-driven currents were simulated in the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic model, using the Wind-Driven Analysis Currents model. This model was used with linear physics so that the wind-driven currents could be related to a time-average of the wind data entered by the user. Both easterly winds and resultant baroclinic flow were simulated in the CATS model, so the wind velocity that the user enters is decomposed into those two components. The total current velocity is then related to the wind stress calculated from the winds input by the user. The wind-driven circulation patterns in this Location File were scaled with respect to the western boundary circulation in the Harrison and Gwydyr Bay Location File. The scaling in the Harrison and Gwydyr Bays Location File was created from fieldwork conducted during August 2001.

Mackenzie River Flow
....................

The Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea and is simulated via user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate, or can enter a flow rate based on real-time or historical flow values.
The three flow values available in the pull-down menu are the high, medium and low flow rates (30000, 20000, and 10000 m3 s-1) calculated from historical flow data from 1972-2010.
To obtain real-time or historical flow values for the Mackenzie River, see the Environment Canada – Water Survey of Canada hydrometric data web page for the “Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River” at http://www.wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/graph/graph_e.html?stn=10LC014. Under the
heading, Data Category, select “Real-Time.” Under the heading, Parameter Type, select “Discharge.” Next to Parameter Type, click “Redraw.” A time-series graph of the discharge is provided in cubic meters per second.

Note: For the Mackenzie River, high, mean, and low estimates were derived from historical data recorded from 1972 to 2010 (http://www.wsc.ec.gc.ca/applications/H2O/graph- eng.cfm?station=10LC014&report=daily&year=2010) and from investigation of the hydrology of the Mackenzie River by the Water Survey of Canada. Additional analysis of these data was provided by the Canadian Mackenzie GEWEX (Global Energy & Water Cycle Experiment) Study (http://www.usask.ca/geography/MAGS/Data/discharge/discharge_e.html). In situ measurements of discharge and the resultant current speeds at principal channels of the Mackenzie were provided by Water Survey of Canada (Roger Pilling – Hydrometric Supervisor, personal communication, June 21, 2012).

Colville River Flow
...................

The Colville River flows into Harrison Bay and is simulated with user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate.
The three flow rates (20,000 cfs, 10,000 cfs, and 3,000 cfs) are estimates of high, medium, and low flow rates for river flow after the extremes of the spring freshet have passed. The 1996 Colville River Delta Channel Assessment by Shannon & Wilson, Inc. was used for flow estimates.

Kuparuk River Flow
..................

The Kuparuk River flows into Gwydyr Bay and is also simulated with user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate, or can enter a flow rate based on real-time or historical flow values.
The three flow values available in the pull-down menu are the mean flow rate (2250 cfs) plus/minus the standard deviation (1550 cfs) calculated from historical flow data from 1971-1999. The historical measurements were taken between July 1 and August 31, with flow rates greater than 10,000 cfs discarded, as we did not simulate these flooding conditions in this Location File.
To obtain real-time or historical flow values for the Kuparuk River, see the USGS Current Water Data for the Nation web page at http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt. On the interactive map, click Alaska (AK). Next, either click the Kuparuk River on the Alaska map or select “Statewide Streamflow Real-Time Table.” Finally (at http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ak/nwis/current/?type=flow), under the heading, “Arctic Slope”, select station number “15896000” for the station Kuparuk River near Deadhorse, Alaska.

Stefansson Sound River Flows
............................

The Stefansson Sound river flows are simulated with user interaction in this Location File. Unfortunately, very little information is available on riverbed bathymetry and flow rates in this region of the Arctic. The Sag River does have a river gauge, with forecasts made at the river’s mouth in the Beaufort Sea; however, these forecasts are not available online. In order to create a useful planning tool in this Location File, we have estimated river circulation patterns and likely river flow rates, based on other rivers in the U.S. We have included simple methods for measuring river currents in the River Flows Help Topic. If measurements of surface currents are unavailable, we recommend that the user choose high and low values for the river flow, and run the model with these values to evaluate the difference.

Example Problems
================

Try out these examples to learn the basics of modeling oil spills in the waters off the North Slope of Alaska. In these examples, you will see how different winds, pollutants, and river flows can affect the trajectories of oil slicks. In addition, you’ll see how model and observation limitations can be overcome by considering both the “Best Estimate” and the “Minimum Regret” (Uncertainty) solutions. This knowledge will help you in designing your own GNOME model runs.

The first four examples are in Stefansson Sound, a region of the Beaufort Sea.

The following conditions hold for each of the examples:

=================   =================================================================
Wind:                Constant at 0 knots, unless otherwise specified.

Spill size:          As specified in each example.

Pollutant type:      Non-weathering, unless specified.

Model duration:      2 days, unless specified.

Uncertainty:         Not included, unless specified.

River Flow Rates:    Mackenzie, Kuparuk and Colville rates “low”, others as specified.
=================   =================================================================


Use GNOME’s Standard Mode and the North Slope Location File to answer the following questions. Be sure to carefully read and enter all the information in each problem.

Example 1.
----------

Winds can have a significant effect on a spill because they influence the currents and move the oil on the surface of the water. To compare the effects of different winds, simulate a spill that occurs on July 1, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. (0900), and continues to spill for about 6 hours. You should observe the spill effects after 2 days. Your scenario should first include 20-knot winds from the east, then 20-knot winds from the west. The Sag, Shaviovik, Canning, and Canning-Tamariak rivers’ flows should be moderately high: 50, 20, 50, and 50 cm/s, respectively. Set a spill of 1000 gallons of medium crude between the Maguire Islands and the mainland, at approximately 70° 12.07'N, 146° 24.16'W.

“Zoom in” to the spill area and describe how the trajectory changes with the wind conditions? How do the beach impacts differ?

****Hints:**** To easily set a spill at a particular location, simply click anywhere on the water area of the map. In the Spill Information window that opens, you can then enter the exact latitude and longitude of the spill. (This method is much easier than moving your mouse around the map and watching its location in the lower left corner of the window!)
To model a point source spill that continues for several hours, you will need to enter the ending time in the Spill Information window. To do this, click the box labeled “Different end release time” and enter the ending time (1500 on July 1, 2004).

**Note:** You will need to use the spill settings from the east wind spill in later examples. Before moving on, save your settings as a Location File Save (LFS) by choosing Save from the GNOME File menu.

**Answer:** When the spill occurs with the east wind, the oil travels west – beaching heavily on Tigvariak Island, the delta of the Shaviovik River, and the eastern section of the Sagavanirktok (Sag) River delta. In comparison, when the spill occurs with the west wind, the oil moves to the east. In this scenario, the most affected shorelines are on Mary Sachs Island and Flaxman Island.

2. Different types of pollutants weather differently. In this example, you’ll re-run the east wind spill (your Location File Save from the previous example), and compare the spill effects of the medium crude spill with those of a kerosene spill. Try to predict how the spills will differ in their behavior, and at the end of your 48-hour prediction, write in the table below the mass balance that GNOME calculates for each product.

=============================  ==============================  ===================
Medium Crude (gallons)          Kerosene/Jet Fuel (gallons)
=============================  ==============================  ===================
   Released                             1,000                       1,000
   Floating
   Beached
   Evaporated and Dispersed
   Off map
=============================  ==============================  ===================


****Hints:**** To view the mass balance for each scenario, click the right-pointing triangle next to the spill description (“Medium Crude: 1000 gallons”) under Spills in the Summary List (the left section of the Map Window). Then click the right pointing triangle next to “Splot Mass Balance” to view the mass balance for the “Best Estimate” trajectory.

**Answer:** Heavier oils remain in the environment longer than lighter, refined products. You can see that after 48 hours, much more kerosene (about 86% of the spill) has evaporated and dispersed than medium crude (about 33%). (Your numbers may differ slightly.) As a result, shoreline impacts are more severe in the medium crude oil spill.

3. Forecasts of environmental parameters are inherently uncertain. For example, wind and weather forecasts can be “off” in their speed, direction, or timing. GNOME supports a “Minimum Regret” solution in addition to the “Best Estimate” solution that you have been running. The “Minimum Regret” solution takes into account our uncertainty in wind, horizontal mixing, and currents.

Rerun the east wind scenario from Example 1, but this time, run GNOME with the “Minimum Regret” solution turned on.

“Zoom in” to the spill area and briefly discuss the difference between the “Best Estimate” (black) and “Minimum Regret” (red) trajectories. Why do you think this type of information would be useful?

**Hint:** To include the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty) solution, click the box labeled “Include the Minimum Regret solution” under Model Settings in the Summary List.

**Answer:**  The “Minimum Regret” solution shows where the spill could go if the currents, winds, or other model inputs were set differently. In this case, the “Minimum Regret” solution shows that the spill effects could be more severe in the regions depicted by the “Best Estimate” scenario, and the spill could be more far- reaching, traveling to more areas of Mikkelson Bay, Foggy Island Bay, and Point Brower.

Responders use both the “Best Estimate” and “Minimum Regret” trajectories to make decisions about how they will allocate response resources. A highly valued environmental resource (e.g. an endangered species) may be important enough to protect, even if it has a low probability of being oiled.

4. In this example, you will simulate a spill that occurs in the delta of the Sag River on July 1, 2004 at 9:00 a.m. (0900), and continues for about 9 hours (until 1800). You should observe the spill effects for 1 day. Your scenario should first include a very slow (5 cm/s) current speed on the Sag River, then a faster flow (100 cm/s, or 1 m/s). In your scenario, include a series of winds that will “push” the oil upriver. Set the 100-barrel “non-weathering” spill in the Sag delta at approximately 70° 19.03'N, 147° 55.34'W.

“Zoom in” to the spill area and note the effects of the different river flows on the spill trajectory and beach impacts.

**Hints:** To make the changes for this scenario, double-click the name of your Location File (“North Slope”) in the Summary List. The Location File Welcome window will appear with all the settings you have chosen. You only have to enter information that you are changing, so in the Model Settings window, change the run duration to 1 day. In the Setting River Flow Speeds window, change all the river flows to slow (5 cm/s). In the Choosing Wind Type window, choose wind that is variable over time.

To enter winds that will drive the oil upriver, you could try a wind series such as this, or make up your own winds:

=============  ========  =========  ==========
Date            Time      Knots      Direction

To enter the winds in the Variable Winds window, first click “Delete All” to clear any winds from your previous work. Next, because the wind observations are 1 hour apart, enter an auto-increment time of 1 hour. To enter a wind, click within the blue Wind Target on the point that represents the wind speed and direction you want to enter (for example, the intersection of the N axis and the 10-knot circle). If necessary, you can hold down your mouse button and drag to adjust the wind speed and direction to the combination you want.

Finally, to change the details of the spill, double-click the spill description (“Kerosene / Jet Fuels: 1000 gallons”) in the Summary List. In the Spill Information window, make the appropriate changes to the spill details.

**Answer:**  When the Sag is flowing more slowly, the winds can carry the oil further upriver, oiling the mud flats, lagoons, Howe Island, and other river islands. When the river is flowing at 1 m/s, the current carries the oil almost completely out of the river mouth, oiling the Endicott drilling island.

The following five examples model oil spills in Harrison and Gwydyr Bays, Alaska. The coastal circulation of the North Slope is primarily controlled by winds, both within the lagoon system and slightly farther offshore.

The following conditions hold for each of the examples:

===========================  ========================
Date:                        August 17, 2001.
Model and Spill Start Time:  1200.
Model duration:              1 day, unless specified in a particular example.
Uncertainty:                 Not included, unless specified.
River Flow Rates:            All rates low or 5 cm/s, unless otherwise specified.
Wind:                        As specified in each example.
Pollutant type:              As specified.
Spill size:                  1000 gallons, unless specified.
Spill Location:              As specified.
===========================  ========================


Use GNOME’s North Slope Location File to answer the following questions:

5. Winds play an important part in the circulation of the coastal North Slope. To compare the effects of different winds, you will simulate a spill that occurs on August 17, 2001, at approximately 1200. Your scenario should include wind of 6 meters/sec first from 75 degrees true, then wind of the same speed from the NW. Set your spill volume at 1000 gallons of medium crude. The spill location is north of the Return Islands (70° 27'N, 148° 41'W).

How do the beach impacts differ in with the different wind conditions? How does the trajectory change?

**Hints:** To easily set a spill at a particular location, simply click anywhere in the water area of the map. In the Spill Information window that opens, you can then enter the exact latitude and longitude of the spill. (This method is much easier than moving your mouse around the map and watching its location in the lower left corner of the window!)

To change the wind conditions, double-click Wind in the Summary List, then change the wind speed and direction in the Constant or Variable Wind window.

Note: You will need to use the spill settings from this example in Example 6. below. Before moving on, save your settings as a Location File Save (LFS) by choosing Save from the GNOME File menu.
North Slope

**Answer:**  The wind causes the oil in each scenario to beach quickly and extensively. With the wind from 75 degrees true, the oil travels to the southwest, impacting the Return Islands and shorelines of Simpson Lagoon. With the NW wind, the oil travels southeast into Prudhoe Bay, with oiling occurring on Stump Island and the Endicott drilling island.

6. Different types of pollutants weather differently. Now you will compare the effects of different types of pollutants. Using your saved files, re-run the scenarios from Example 5, but this time change the pollutant type to a light product, such as gasoline.
How does the “weathering” of the pollutants affect the spill impacts?

**Hints:** To quickly change the pollutant type, double-click the spill description (“Medium Crude: 1000 gallons”) under Spills in the Summary List (the left section of the Map Window). In the Spill Information window, choose “gasoline” from the Pollutant pull-down menu.

**Answer:**  Heavier oils remain in the environment longer than lighter, refined products. Beach impacts from the crude oil spill are much more extensive than for the gasoline spill in both wind scenarios. (To view the mass balance for a scenario, click the right-pointing triangle next to the spill description, “Gasoline: 1000 gallons”, under Spills in the Summary List. Then click the right-pointing triangle next to “Splot Mass Balance” to view the mass balance for the “Best Estimate” trajectory. You should see that about 98% of the gasoline evaporated and dispersed in each of these scenarios.)

7. In the next scenario, you will see how the Kuparuk River flow influences the large- scale circulation during normal summer conditions. You can set up the new scenario in either of two ways: (1) You can make the changes shown below in the appropriate sections of the Summary List; or (2) You can close your file (choose Close from the GNOME File menu), then double-click Location File in the Summary List. Choose the North Slope Location File and enter these conditions in the Location File dialog boxes:

* Wind speed is zero.
* Model duration is 2 days.
* Colville River flow set as “low”.
* Pollutant type is “non-weathering”.
* Spill location is a point east of Gwydyr Bay, between the Return Islands
  and the mainland (70° 25'N, 148° 42'W).

Next, try running the scenario with each of these Kuparuk River flow rates:


(a) low - 700 cfs (b) mean - 2250 cfs (c) high - 3800 cfs
Note: After setting up GNOME for the low Kuparuk River flow scenario, save your work as a Location File Save (LFS). You will use those settings in Example 8 below.
How does the trajectory change with the different river conditions?

**Answer:**  The oil spreads farther, particularly to the east, with higher river flows. The higher the river flow rate, the more the outflow will keep oil out of the river delta.

8. Forecasts of environmental parameters are inherently uncertain. For example, wind and weather forecasts can be “off” in the speed, direction, or timing of the winds. GNOME supports a “Minimum Regret” solution in addition to the “Best Estimate” solution that you have been running. The Minimum Regret solution takes into account our uncertainty in wind, horizontal mixing, and currents. Using your saved file from Example 7 (a), add the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty) solution to your settings to see where else the spill might go.
Briefly discuss the difference between the “Best Estimate” (black) and “Minimum Regret” (red) trajectories. Why do you think this type of information would be useful?

**Hints:** To include the Minimum Regret (Uncertainty) solution, click the box labeled “Include the Minimum Regret solution” under Model Settings in the Summary List.

**Answer:**  The Minimum Regret solution shows more extensive impacts in all directions. In addition, it shows that there could be oil contact in the river delta, outside the Return Islands, and east of Gwydyr Bay. Responders use the “minimum regret” trajectory to make decisions about how they will allocate response resources. Sometimes a highly valued environmental resource (e.g. an endangered species) may be important enough to protect, even if it has a low probability of being oiled.

9. The Colville River also influences the large-scale circulation of this region. To compare the effects of different river flow rates, simulate a spill that occurs on August 17, 2001 at 1200. Set the model duration to 2 days, and don’t include the Minimum Regret solution. The wind is constant during this time at 20 knots from the east. For now, set both the Colville and Kuparuk River flow rates to “Low”. The pollutant released is 1000 barrels of medium crude, spilled at the mouth of the Colville River (70° 27'N, 150° 9'W). It continues to spill for the next 24 hours.

After you’ve run the low river flow conditions, re-run the simulation with a medium (10,000 cfs), and then high (20,000 cfs), flow rate for the Colville River only.
What effect(s) do the Colville River flow changes have on the trajectory and shoreline impacts of this spill?

**Hint:** To model a continuous release, in the Spill Information window, click the box labeled “Different end release time”, and enter August 18th as the end release time.

**Answer:**  Higher river flows keep the oil offshore longer so that response equipment, like skimmers and boom, can be mobilized.
In the low flow condition (shown below), the “Best Estimate” or Forecast trajectory shows that after 2 days, heavy oiling has occurred in the Colville River delta.


Low river flow condition [needimage here]

In the medium flow condition, the extent of beaching in the delta is not as severe. In this case, the fresh water from the higher river flow is pushing the oil out of the inlet, and the wind is pushing the oil west of the delta. The oil remains offshore until the oil spreads far enough to find a place where the river outflow is less, and then the wind pushes it onshore in a limited area.

Medium river flow condition [need image here]

In the high flow condition, most of the oil is pushed offshore by the higher river flow, where it is affected by the wind and coastal circulation. While this gives responders time to deploy equipment, it also means that the oil can travel a greater distance, possibly causing shoreline impacts to be more widespread.
