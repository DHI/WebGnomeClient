Oil Fate Wizard
===============

To get started using the Oil Fate Wizard, visit:
https://gnome.orr.noaa.gov/#adios

The Oil Fate Wizard provides a simple interface to quickly set up and explore the fate of an oil spilled in the open ocean, relatively far from shore. It models the spill as though it were in an infinite ocean with no land anywhere.

This can be suitable for exploring the time scale of a spill -- how long will visible surface expression be present? As well as issues such as windows of opportunity for response -- how likely is this oil to be dispersible two days after the release?

The Oil Fate Wizard makes it easy to set up the model to address these sorts of questions without requiring as many model inputs (e.g., currents and shoreline information).

Location File Wizard
====================

To get started using WebGNOME Location Files, visit:
https://gnome.orr.noaa.gov/#locations

The Location File Wizard will guide you through setting up a scenario with a
series of questions. The exact questions depend on the specific region being modeled but may include
questions about: wind conditions, river flow rates, circulation patterns, and the
type of spill to be modeled.
If you need help answering a Wizard question, a Location File Help button is available
on the Wizard title bar.

The Location File Help topics and User Guides also provide some sources of real-time and historical data
about the region and more technical information about the Location File development.
