About Location Files
====================

Location Files were created to guide users through the model setup for a
specific region. Each Location File contains pre-packaged
information about the tides, currents, and shorelines in the region it covers.
WebGNOME uses the Location File information and user input to set up the model.

Location Files are useful for planning but should not be used to model real oil spills!

Location File Wizard
====================

The Location File Wizard asks questions to help you set up the spill scenario.

The exact questions depends on the specific region being modeled but may include: spill
information, wind conditions, river flow rates, and circulation patterns.
If you need help answering a Wizard question, a Location File Help button is available
on the Wizard title bar.

The Location File Help topics also provide some sources of real-time and historical data
about the region and more technical information about the Location File development.
