WebGnomeClient
==============

Javascript client that uses the WebGnomeAPI to create and run py_gnome models.

## Setup
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) are required to install and manage this application. Assuming both are installed on your system a simple `npm install` from inside the `WebGnomeClient` directory should install and prep everything for the app.

## Commands
<dl>
    <dt>`npm install`</dt>
    <dd>Installs all of the applications dependencies described in `package.json` using npm and `bower.json` using bower</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
    <dt>`npm start`</dt>
    <dd>Compiles the backbone application into `js/build.js` and starts a node http server to serve the application. *Currently `js/build.js` isn't referenced by any thing and start it just used to build it, this needs reevaluation.*
